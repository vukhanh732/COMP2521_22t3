Question 10

Which of the listed data structures is most suitable? Justify your
answer. You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.

I would use hash table data structures. Hash table data structure has an average time complexities of O(1) for 
all the operations asked in the question. We can easily delete a key-element pair with lowest key with the hash function which
also takes O(1). Remove In-range is also easy because we know where key-elements pairs is stored from the hash function. For hash
collision, I would use double hashing so deletion will be even faster since we know where the key is stored at.
