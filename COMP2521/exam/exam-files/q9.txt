Question 9

Which data structure and algorithm would you use to solve the task?
Justify your answer.

For this problem I will use a graph data structure - adjacency matrix to solve. Each island is a vertex and the
bridge will be edges. I used adjacency matrix because there are only 9 vertexes which won't use a lot of space, and 
it is also fast and easy to implement. The algorithm I would use is minimum spanning tree to keep the cost as low as possible 
and ensure that all islands are connected.
