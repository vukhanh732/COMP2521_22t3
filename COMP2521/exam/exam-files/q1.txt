Question 1

What is the time complexity of the algorithm? Justify your answer.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2). The time it takes
to convert the algorithm into 2 subproblem is O(n). For every function call
n will be become smaller by 4. Therefore, the complexity will be O(n*(n-4))
Which is 
O(n^2)
