NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2)

- Explanation: Because worst case, we have to traverse through every cell and every edges to find the exit

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2)

- Explanation: same implementation
